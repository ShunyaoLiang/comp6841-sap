abstract = {We present a micro-architectural side-channel attack that runs entirely in the browser. In contrast to previous work in this genre, our attack does not require the attacker to install software on the victim's machine; to facilitate the attack, the victim needs only to browse to an untrusted webpage that contains attacker-controlled content. This makes our attack model highly scalable, and extremely relevant and practical to today's Web, as most desktop browsers currently used to access the Internet are affected by such side channel threats. Our attack, which is an extension to the last-level cache attacks of Liu et al., allows a remote adversary to recover information belonging to other processes, users, and even virtual machines running on the same physical host with the victim web browser. We describe the fundamentals behind our attack, and evaluate its performance characteristics. In addition, we show how it can be used to compromise user privacy in a common setting, letting an attacker spy after a victim that uses private browsing. Defending against this side channel is possible, but the required countermeasures can exact an impractical cost on benign uses of the browser.},

abstract = {Research showed that microarchitectural attacks like cache attacks can be performed through websites using JavaScript. These timing attacks allow an adversary to spy on users secrets such as their keystrokes, leveraging fine-grained timers. However, the W3C and browser vendors responded to this significant threat by eliminating fine-grained timers from JavaScript. This renders previous high-resolution microarchitectural attacks non-applicable.We demonstrate the inefficacy of this mitigation by finding and evaluating a wide range of new sources of timing information. We develop measurement methods that exceed the resolution of official timing sources by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude on all major browsers, and even more on Tor browser. Our timing measurements do not only re-enable previous attacks to their full extent but also allow implementing new attacks. We demonstrate a new DRAM-based covert channel between a website and an unprivileged app in a virtual machine without network hardware. Our results emphasize that quick-fix mitigations can establish a dangerous false sense of security.},
